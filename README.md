# WordPress Starter Theme
**[By Jens Ahrengot Boddum](http://ahrengot.com/)**

This is a basic starter theme for WordPress websites (Not blogs). It's based on [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and uses the [Compass CSS preprocessor](http://compass-style.org/).

A lot of backend cleanup is handled by **backend.php**, and custom post types and custom taxonomies are ready, but commented out, in **custom-post-type.php**.

## Open Graph tags (Facebook)
If you install the awesome [WordPress SEO](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin this theme fetches the title and description data and renders it to open graph tags used by Facebook.

Other than that the post thumbnail is used as og:image and fb:admins is hardcoded into **head.php**

## This theme includes the following JavaScript libraries: 
- Backbone.js, 
- Underscore.js, 
- TweenMax (And TweenLite, TimelineLite, etc.)

## … And the following jQuery plugins:
- scrollTo
- placeholder






*… Have fun!*
